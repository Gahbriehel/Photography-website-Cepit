      <h2>Cepit Imaging Terms and Conditions</h2>
      <h4>
        This page details the current terms and conditions for Cepit Imaging.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Thank you for booking a portrait photography session with Cepit Imaging
        (“me/I/my/the photographer”). Please read these Terms and Conditions
        carefully, as they apply to your (“you/the client”) booking
        (“Photography Services/photo shoot session/sitting”). I am happy to
        answer any questions or concerns you may have in relation to these T&Cs
        at any time. However, continuing with your booking means you are
        agreeing with these terms. I reserve the right to change these Terms &
        Conditions at any time, and I will give reasonable notice to you if this
        happens.
      </p>
      <h3>GENERAL</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms and Conditions constitute an agreement between the parties
        and supersede all previous agreements between the parties relating to
        its subject matter. No variation or agreed termination of these terms
        and conditions (or of any document referred to in it) shall be effective
        unless it is in writing. If any provision of this agreement (or part of
        any provision) is found by any court or other authority of competent
        jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other
        provisions shall remain in force. A person who is not a party to this
        agreement shall not have any rights under or in connection with it. This
        agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with
        it or its subject matter shall be governed by and construed in
        accordance with the law of Nigeria.
      </p>
      <h3>ACCEPTANCE</h3>
      <p>
        Your booking and/or payment of your session fee signifies acceptance of
        these terms and conditions as a legally binding contract, unless
        otherwise objected to explicitly and in writing, prior to accepting my
        service. No variation of this contract shall be recognized unless
        explicitly agreed to in writing. Any booking or payment made to me
        (including the session fee) indicates that you have read, understood and
        agreed to all the terms and conditions as set out in this document, in
        its entirety. If this contract has to be enforced, you agree to
        mediation instead of court proceedings.
      </p>
      <h3>COPYRIGHT & OWNERSHIP</h3>
      <p>
        The copyright and all other rights in the Photos shall be retained by
        BAP Studios in accordance with Section 10 of the Nigerian Copyright Act,
        2004. Any unauthorized reproduction or modification of any images will
        constitute a breach of copyright. This includes making copies or 'screen
        shots' of images shared by the photographer online. The photographer
        reserves the right to use the images for advertorial purposes on social
        media platforms and on the website. Sometimes the photographer may share
        previews or “sneak peeks” of your images, or give you access to an
        online gallery of images. These images must not be copied, screen shot,
        downloaded, edited or altered in any way. If you wish to share
        photographs to your own network (i.e. Facebook, blog or any other online
        channels) you agree to do so only once you have purchased and paid for
        them. In addition, you agree to include the photographer's company name
        (CepitImaging). Clients are not permitted to take their own photographs
        at any portrait photography session.
      </p>
      <h3>RESERVATIONS</h3>
      <p>
        Your portrait session is reserved only once paid for. Session fees are
        non-refundable and contribute towards the photographer's time planning
        your shoot with you
      </p>
      <h3>RESCHEDULING & REFUNDS/CANCELLATIONS</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes it is necessary for the photographer or client to reschedule,
        for example due to injury or serious illness. If there are unavoidable
        circumstances that affect your ability to take part in our photo shoot
        session, then I am happy for us to reschedule once, within a three-month
        period. Please let me know as soon as possible that you can no longer
        make the session, and at least 48 hours in advance. Please note that any
        new date will be subject to the Photographer's availability. I shall use
        reasonable endeavour to arrange an alternative date for your photo shoot
        session. In the event that we cannot agree another date, or if you are
        unable to attend your re-booked session, then your session fee will be
        lost. Your session fee is non-refundable should you decide to cancel
        your portrait shoot.
      </p>
      <h3>PRICES & PAYMENTS</h3>
      <p>
        The price for your photo shoot session will be as agreed at the time of
        booking. Booking your session by paying your session fee guarantees that
        you receive my current portrait rates. Sessions rescheduled by the
        client are subject to the prices current at the time of rescheduling.
        Prices on the website or on marketing materials may be out of date, and
        I reserve the right to adjust prices at any time without prior notice. .
        All photo shoot sessions must be taken within 3 months of the session
        fee payment being made. Any exceptions to this need to be agreed in
        writing, and the current prices and booking conditions will apply. The
        balance is to be paid in full before any prints, albums or other
        products are ordered on your behalf. Payment can be made by Bank
        Transfer, or via cash in person.
      </p>
      <h3>SESSION TIMES & DURATION</h3>
      <p>
        Please make every effort to arrive on time for your session and please
        let me know as soon as possible if you anticipate arriving late. If you
        are less than fifteen minutes late, your session length may be reduced
        accordingly. If you are more than fifteen minutes late, your session may
        be cancelled, with no refund or re-shoot provided. Makeup must be done
        prior to arriving at the studio. Should you require makeup services,
        there is a make up artist available at an extra cost. Should you prefer
        to use your own make up artist and complete your make up at the studio,
        this will attract an extra charge. If a session duration is not
        specified as part of your package, I will end the session at my
        discretion when I determine that adequate images in terms of quality and
        quantity have been captured.
      </p>
      <h3>CREATIVE LICENSE</h3>
      <p>
        You grant the photographer full creative license to shoot, select
        images, edit images and deliver them in the style and method chosen by
        the photographer and reflective of the style and quality advertised by
        the photographer.
      </p>
      <h3>IMAGE ARCHIVING</h3>
      <p>
        I will keep all images on archive for one month from the date of your
        photo shoot session, after which they may be permanently deleted. It is
        your responsibility to backup any digital files you receive. Please
        create multiple backups on different devices, and ensure the safe
        keeping of any prints, albums or other products.
      </p>
      <h3>DATA PROTECTION</h3>
      <p>
        Cepit Imaging will store Client names, contact details and session
        information privately and will not share these with any other business
        or organization.
